    let age = 30;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 50;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'gov';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = [...players];
    console.log(players, team2);
    team2[3] = 'vijay';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.table(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {team: 'India', age: 12});
    console.table(cap2);
    console.table(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
